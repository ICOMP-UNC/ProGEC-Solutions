# ProGEC-Solutions

## Project Description

The project aims to develop a robust structural monitoring and alert system for buildings, capable of detecting environmental and structural conditions that may indicate potential risks, such as collapses or other forms of deterioration. The system will continuously monitor vibration levels and humidity within walls and floors, using vibration and capacitive humidity sensors to assess risks and log environmental data. It will issue alerts if conditions indicate structural instability or if remediation actions are overdue, ensuring users are promptly informed of any risks. Key features include a real-time alert system with a buzzer, historical data logging to track degradation patterns, and a user-friendly interface with LED indicators to communicate building status via a color-coded (green/yellow/red) scheme. Additionally, the system will employ Direct Memory Access (DMA) for efficient peripheral communication.

## Project Objectives and Success Criteria

- **Effective Hazard Detection**: Achieve reliable monitoring of vibrations and humidity, ensuring accurate detection of structural risks.
- **Timely Alerts**: Implement a rapid alert system with minimal latency, using buzzer notifications and a visual LED panel.
- **Historical Analysis and Data Logging**: Enable comprehensive data logging to analyze trends over time and assess structural health effectively.
- **User Interface and Interaction**: Provide an intuitive interface with color-coded LEDs and a manual alarm switch, enhancing usability for non-technical users.
- **Scalability and Robustness**: Design a fault-tolerant system that allows for seamless integration of additional sensors and maintains performance despite potential individual component failures.
